Mix paint by from base pigments using the Kubelka-Munk equations.

Based on the paper:
T. Lindemeier, J. M. GÃ¼lzow, and O. Deussen. 2018. Painterly rendering using limited paint color palettes. In Proceedings of the Conference on Vision, Modeling, and Visualization (EG VMV '18). Eurographics Association, Goslar Germany, Germany, 135-145. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2312/vmv.20181263

## This is work in progress
I'm porting the unpublished original implementation to this public repo step by step. I am currently focusing on my other project  [prgl](https://github.com/lindemeier/prgl) though.
